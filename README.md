# Sporclone: React Edition

This web app is a recreation of my [previous Sporclone project][old-sporclone]
using modern technologies.

This new iteration of Sporclone is built on top of:

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com)
- [Material-UI Framework](https://material-ui.com)
